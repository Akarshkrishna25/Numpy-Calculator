This project is a menu-driven Python application that performs arithmetic, statistical, and array manipulation operations using NumPy.
It supports 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays with proper input validation and shape checking.
A decorator is used to measure and display the execution time of each operation.
The program includes robust error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
It is designed as a learning-oriented project to demonstrate NumPy operations, decorators, and array handling in Python.
